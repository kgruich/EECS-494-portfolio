<ul>
<li>For the first milestone while creating this Unity remaster, I did a lot of work on the movement and room system. This also included work on player collection UI and locked doors.</li>
<li>For the alpha, I focused on designing the enemy AI for our various NPCs, and laying out the rooms to match the original Zelda.</li>
<li>For the gold build, I designed our custom mechanic: the bouncing fireball weapon and the exploding fireball weapon. This, along with the aiming, and fixing many of the inauthentic parts of our previous build was my focus.</li>
</ul>
